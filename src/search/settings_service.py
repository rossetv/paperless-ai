"""Read, diff and re-index-impact logic for the Settings API (web-redesign §5).

The Settings endpoints (:mod:`search.settings_routes`) are a thin HTTP shell;
the logic they need that is worth testing in isolation lives here, FastAPI-free:

- :func:`view_settings` resolves every config key to its *effective* value
  and *source* (``database`` / ``environment`` / ``default``), so the Settings
  screen can show where each value comes from.
- :func:`validate_change_set` checks a proposed change against the catalogue
  and against :func:`common.config.build_settings`, so an invalid value is
  rejected *before* it touches ``app.db``.
- :func:`reindex_required` reports whether any changed key needs a full
  document re-index. Saving hot-loads with no restart (spec §5); the only
  operator-facing consequence of a change is whether the index must be
  rebuilt — true exactly when a :data:`common.config.REINDEX_KEYS` key moved.

Allowed deps: common.config (the key catalogue and the settings builder).
Forbidden: fastapi, sqlite3, appdb (the routes layer owns the DB connection).
